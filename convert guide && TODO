Tips:
1: fastf_t is double, point_t is double[3], off_t is standard, mat_t is a double[16], vect_t is a double[4] and bu_vls is a string (can be replaced with any number of string options (e.g., std::string if you switch to c++)
2: those are basic containers, can directly convert to std:: containers, converted to C struct containers, or left alone and carry the functions it's using along
3: those all can directly convert to stdlib functions (calloc, malloc, realloc, ftell)
4: bu_log == fprintf(stderr
5: nmg is our generalized polygonal format (e.g., a quad or a 12-sided polygon), probably not relevant to you.  triangle meshes are handled via a different container, far more simple
6: suggest just tackling on at a time, especially given info on 1-5, maybe it will seem more obvious in that context.
7. std::set, std::map
8. std::vector ? std::list ?

TO DO List:

checked * Clean up all the unnessecery code like bu_log(), nmg
checked * Switch all data type as much as possible
checked * replicate and modified functions if needed from dependency if possible or write a new one
checked ** vmath.h
checked ** mat.h
checked ** color.h
checked * Switch up some functions that can be directly converted to std function like strncmp()
checked * Defining DEG2RAD M_PI, other values that needed defined else where etc
checked * complete convert bu_list
checked * complete convert bn_vert_tree
* complete convert vls to std::string? but there are lot of functions and memory allocation stuff
* fix bu_get, bu_optget, bu_put function.
* fix mk_  wdb_ inheritance function.
* complete convert bu_ptbl
* What to do with nurb.h dependency?
checked * Fix all bu_alloc(), bu_malloc, bu_realloc(), bu_calloc() 
  except circle_pts has a error expression must be a modifiable lvalue
* Rerange main() function (More details needed)

Question:

checked * M_2PI is 2 * M_PI or M_2_PI ? treated as 2 * M_PI
checked * UNUSED(textScale) UNUSED(textFlag) what to do with these ? Removed UNUSED() in the drawMtext, drawString.
* wdb.h write data base, do we need it?
* Do we need drawMtext, drawstring functions??
* EQUAL() what is this different than a == b ? can't find def
* What to do with bu_put, bu_get, bu_getopt, bu_optarg, bu_exit, bu_debug,
  bu_optind, bu_debug_coredump, .


Development Note: 

* Replaced state_stack with std::list<state_data> state_stack
* Replaced block_list with std::list<block_list> block_head
* bu_list_init as a circular list without allocating memory.
* I am currently ignored all the bu_list_init.
* Did not replace bn_vert_tree, replicated code from vert_tree.h, vert_tree.c 
  to avoid dependency. I think it's better to preserve the bn_vert_tree 
  because it contains tree structure, it needs to return the index of the array.
* Couldn't find bn_vert_tree inheritance, bn_vert_tree replaced by vert_root,
  bn_vert_tree_create() replaced by create_vert_tree(), bn_vert_tree_add() replaced by
  Add_vert(). Normals are not included.
* ignored BN_CK_VERT_TREE() because it would drag in a lot of other code but this is just
  checking if the structure is valid. Looks like it could be ignored.
* Replaced bu_bomb with fprintf(stderr, )
* Could not find the def for VINI_ZERO just replace it by simply inilizing the double[4]
  all equals 0 by guessing.
* Added a NEAR_EQUAL function for the undefined NEAR_EQAUL, replace EQUAL() with ==
* replaced both bu_malloc and bu_ALLOC with malloc()
* Replace if(!vls) with (std::string vls.empty()). if(vls) with (!vls.empty())
* Replace strcat(vls, line) to std::string vls += std::string str(line) 
* define SQRT_SMALL_FASTF    1.0e-39, there is another def 1.0e-40 should we choose that one instead?
